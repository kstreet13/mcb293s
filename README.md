The measles heatmap is from a [blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/01/22/the-dslabs-package-provides-datasets-for-teaching-data-science/) by Rafael Irizarry.

**Subsetting a dataset**:
sub <- data[ data$variable == "value" , ]

Please submit a figure of your choice using the weekly US disease data to kstreet@berkeley.edu.
